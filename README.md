I wrote these lines in vim, on a chromebook, in a virtual machine. I am now a master of exiting and saving vim files. Git for cmdline is kinda stupid annoying though.

Python is the only thing that runs fast, hence why it's the only language I wrote stuff in.

Bash is kinda cool? Makes it easier to run a commit.
